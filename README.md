# Parallel computing project

In this project, we analyse different approaches for the optimization of the computation of an image filtering pipeline, using as tools the Message Passing Interface(MPI), Open Multi-Processing(OpenMP) and CUDA. The objective of this project is to understand the bottlenecks and trade-offs that occur when optimizing a problem in the domain of high performance computing.
